=> what is tables and Database
   Table is a collection of data, organising in terms of rows and columns
   Database :- In SQL a dataBase is a collection of Table

=> Let's create our first Database
 => SHOW DATAASES;                         # list all dataBase
 => CREATE DATABASE database_name          # creating a dataBase
 => DROP DATAASES database_name            # deleting a dataBase
 => USE database_name                      # using a dataBase

=> these datatypes are enough for biginners
=> dataTypes in SQL
 => INT : Whole numbers        //23
 => FLOAT (M,D) : Decimal number (approximate)   // 12.34
 => DECIMAL (M,D) : Decimal number (precise)     // 

=> Non numeric dataType
 => CHAR(N) : fixed length character          // for fixed length it is usefull  ( It is faster compared to VARCHAR)
 => VARCHAR(N) : varying length character     // saving space when it is non linear
 => BOOLEAN : true or false value             // 
 => ENUM('M', 'F') : value from defined list

=> Date and Time type
 => DATE : Date(YYYY-MM-DD)
 => TIME : Time(HH-MM-SS)
 => DATETIME : Data and Time (YYYY-MM-DD- HH-MM-SS)
 => YEAR : year(YYYY)

=> Creating table syntax

 CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraints,
    column2 datatype constraints,
    ...........
    ...........
 )

 Note : constraints are optional

 constraints in SQL => SQL constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table
 
 1) NOT NULL
 2) UNIQUE
 3) PRIMARY KEY
 4) FORGINE KEY
 5) CHECK
 6) DEFAULT

 constraints - Not NULL
 => This constraint tells that we cannot store a null value in a column. That is, if a column is spesified as NOT NULL
    then we will not be able to store null in This particular column any more
 constraint - UNIQUE
 => if there is any dulicate value then it will show error in the column

 constraint - Primary Key
 => This constrins when spscified with can uniqely identified each row in a table. And this constraint is used to specify 
    a field in a primary Key
    => primary key = Not Null + UNIQUE
=> Each table can have only one primary key

=> constraint - FORGINE Key
 => Forgine key is used to link two tables together
 => It is a column whose value mathes the value of another table's primary key column
 => A table can have multiple column
 => Foregine Key also prevent actions that will destroy relations between two Tables

 constraint - CHECK
 => this constraint helps to validate the value of a column to meet a particular condition
    Age column has Check(age > 18) constraints
 
 constraints - DEFAULT
 => the DEFAULT constraints is used to set a DEFAULT value for a column

 Table commands 
  => DROP TABLE table_name                # deleting a table
  => DESCRIBE table_name                  # meta data about column
  => INSERT table_name(col1,col2, ...)    # inserting a table
